## Repo for learning Github

**Looking at re-learning Github for myself. I'm not sure why it didn't stick the first time, but here I am again. Still crazy to see
how long it's been since I've used it and also. It still frustrates me too because I feel like this me falling so far behind. I've
got tons to catch up in OS and I also missed out on the first exam and I've got no idea how to explain this to my professor or if
there's anything I can do to catch up. I just don't want to waste time and my wife is working so hard to put me through college and
I don't wanna to disappoint her or let her down. God, I really need your help. This is just too much for me to handle, but I know if 
I believe in You, You would make a way. You would be there to help me and strengthen me where I've failed.**
